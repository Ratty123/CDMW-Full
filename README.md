# Crimson Desert Mod Workbench

Windows desktop workbench for Crimson Desert archive browsing, texture workflows,
mesh preview/modding, material replacement, media preview, and research tooling.

## Known Limitations

`Weapon Placement Studio` is currently disabled in the UI. This is intentional,
not just unfinished polish: in-game testing showed that the true 1H/offhand and
full behavior-swap paths need more than partial ItemInfo/PAAC edits and can hang
or crash the game. The embedded D3D11 placement preview is also disabled because
the host can freeze the app. The repo still keeps the learned socket templates
and CTF smoke checks for manual package work, but the studio is not shipped as a
supported workflow.

## Features

- Browse `.pamt` / `.paz` archives with flat/tree views, filters, extraction,
  cache reuse, text preview, media preview, and explicit patch/restore flows.
- Preview supported `.pam`, `.pamlod`, and `.pac` meshes with the native D3D11
  preview path, referenced texture inspection, OBJ/FBX export, and supported
  OBJ/DAE/glTF/GLB import preview workflows.
- Run DDS texture workflows with the bundled `cd-texture-dx.exe` native
  DirectXTex helper, optional Real-ESRGAN NCNN/chaiNNer upscaling, texture
  policy planning, compare review, and mod-package export.
- Use `Texture Replacer` to replace edited PNG/DDS textures using the original game DDS as rebuild
  authority, including package-prefixed loose output and manager metadata.
- Edit visible textures in-app with layered projects, selections, masks,
  adjustment layers, channel locks, brush tools, clone/heal, smudge, sharpen,
  soften, and flattened PNG export.
- Build and audit material/mesh replacement packages with Material Authority,
  source-owned material routing, runtime XML preservation, diagnostics, and
  final package preview.
- Use supporting workspaces for Model Library, Mesh Editor, Icon Creator,
  Recolor Variants, Texture Research, Text Search, settings/profile export,
  diagnostic bundles, and detachable tabs.

## Safety Model

Archive mutation is explicit. Browsing, previewing, extracting, scanning, and
package building do not silently rewrite game archives. Supported archive patch
flows use confirmation, preflight checks, backups, and restore support.

Keep local game archives, extracted assets, DDS payloads, build output, crash
reports, restore points, and corpus data out of source control.

## Install

1. Download the latest Windows portable EXE from
   [Releases](https://github.com/Ratty123/crimson-desert-mod-workbench/releases).
2. Run `CrimsonDesertModWorkbench-<version>-windows-portable.exe`.
3. In `Texture Workflow > Setup`, initialize a workspace and configure roots.
4. DDS preview, staging, and rebuild use the bundled `cd-texture-dx.exe`
   helper automatically. Configure optional upscaling tools only if needed:
   - Real-ESRGAN NCNN for direct upscaling
   - chaiNNer for existing `.chn` chains

Portable config is stored beside the EXE. App-managed folders live under
`workspace/`, including original DDS files, staging, outputs, extracts,
libraries, tools, cache, logs, sessions, projects, and research data.

## Source Setup

Requirements:

- Windows
- Python 3.11 or 3.14 (the two release-tested interpreters)
- PowerShell
- CMake/MSVC toolchain for native helper builds

Install Python dependencies:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install "pip==25.3"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -c constraints-release.txt -r requirements-build.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install "pytest==9.0.3"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\verify_release_dependencies.py
```

Run tests:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
```

Run the app from source:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe cdmw_app.py
```

## Build

Build a publishable onefile EXE:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build_pyside6_app.ps1 -Mode onefile -BuildProfile release
```

Release builds require the exact versions in `constraints-release.txt`, publish
the bundled .NET Mesh Editor as a self-contained `win-x64` single file, and run
an offscreen startup smoke. Output is published only after the atomic result
marker reports `post_construction`.

Expected output:

```text
dist\CrimsonDesertModWorkbench-<version>-windows-portable.exe
```

Build a folder/onedir package:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build_pyside6_app.ps1 -Mode onedir -BuildProfile release
```

Useful wrappers:

- `build.bat onefile release`
- `build.bat onedir release`
- `build.bat` for the graphical build picker

## Privacy

The app does not include telemetry, analytics, auto-update checks, or background
network calls for normal offline use. Crash reports and diagnostic bundles stay
local until you export and share them. It opens external pages only from
explicit user actions such as download/help links.
