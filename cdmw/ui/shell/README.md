# UI Shell

Owns the main window shell, workspace layout, tab registry, actions, menus,
toolbar, status bar, settings/theme/language wiring, startup/close controllers,
activation handling, diagnostics, and app-level dialogs.

`compact/` owns the restart-selected Compact Workspace presentation around the
same authoritative tool widgets. Compact is the first-run default; an existing
Classic or Compact choice remains authoritative. Compact mode
hides the existing tab bars, routes its rail through the shared activation
path, reuses the existing actions and status widgets, and never constructs a
second tool/controller/worker tree. Its shared application theme and category state
are documented in `docs/features/compact-workspace.md`.
The Compact navigation rail sizes to its labels, icons, and layout margins,
including room for a scrollbar, so it stays narrow without clipping larger fonts
or longer translations. Collapsing categories keeps that width stable.
Lazy tools reveal an indeterminate progress bar immediately, preload only Qt-free
data dependencies on a tracked low-priority thread, then import their UI module,
construct the widget, and apply presentation in separate GUI turns. Tool-specific
I/O remains in its owning workers, and shell shutdown retains both preload and
feature threads until native teardown completes. Translation and language-export
property inspection must not construct unopened lazy tools.
Archive Browser's compact Select, Actions, and More Filters triggers retain their
existing routing while rendering normal, hover, pressed/open-menu, focus, and
disabled button states.
`archive_backend_client.py` owns the resident, bounded `QProcess` protocol and
nonblocking shutdown lifecycle for the independent full archive worker;
`archive_backend_resources.py` owns packaged and development worker discovery.
The shell defaults to v2, validates protocol/native ABI/index compatibility
before dispatch, and never silently falls back. A catalogue-publication failure
offers retry, cancel, or a legacy scan for the current process only. Explicit
session fallback cancels tracked requests, restores the legacy tree model, and
requests nonblocking worker shutdown without persisting a setting.

Keep this package focused on application frame behavior. Feature tabs belong in
`cdmw/ui/<feature>/`; business coordination belongs in `cdmw/services/`; slow
work belongs in `cdmw/workers/`. `MainWindow` uses the shell-owned `WorkbenchWindow`;
shell and feature behavior uses ordinary methods on owning widgets and
controllers. There is no runtime provider registry or generated method manifest.

`Help > Documentation` is the app's wiki surface. It uses a hierarchical topic
tree, a generated all-topic index, multi-word relevance search with `Ctrl+K`,
article links, breadcrumbs, and back/forward history. English topic data in
`about_documentation_en.py` is the single source; all 14 built-in languages use
the shared localization catalog instead of maintaining separate translated
topic copies.

Settings font sizes are exact user preferences; responsive screen scaling may
compact spacing and control metrics, but it does not rewrite the chosen UI or
list font size. The five-page Settings navigation—Setup, General, Paths,
Performance, and Appearance—is a top-aligned, content-sized rail whose width
follows its translated labels instead of taking a fixed sidebar width and
full-window height.

`cdmw/ui/display_scaling.py` installs one application display policy for the shell,
late-created tools, and Qt dialogs. Text controls follow their font and translated
label metrics. The current tool has an overflow scroll area; inactive tools do
not impose their minimum size on it. Oversized separate windows fit the current
screen's available work area and retain reachable content in a scroll area.
Overflow wrapping happens once, preserving the central widget and nested preview
parents on subsequent resizes. Screen, work-area, and DPI changes refresh the
shell metrics once; ordinary resizing keeps the inexpensive path.

Research and Textures action rows wrap, and Settings Performance cards switch
between one and two columns. Compact rail/status heights follow the font, and its
line icons rasterize at the requesting device pixel ratio. The Qt display matrix
and its scope are documented in `docs/test-matrix.md`.

All 19 application themes use semantic palette roles for shared and
feature-owned chrome. Feature surfaces may retain intentional content colours
only with an explicit paired foreground; they must not pin buttons, fields,
selection, warnings, editors, or disabled text to a Graphite-era literal.
Use `accent_text` on `accent`, and `text_strong` on `accent_soft`; the two
foregrounds are not interchangeable. Button text targets at least 4.5:1 contrast
in normal, hover, pressed, checked, and disabled states.
`tests/test_theme_surface_coherence.py` applies every theme to real Classic
Placement, Mesh Editor, Archive Browser, New Item, and XML-editor surfaces and
guards new stylesheet/rich-text literals. It also checks painted button text in
both Classic and Compact. Compact's separate synthetic harness
continues to cover the same production widgets at its supported sizes.
