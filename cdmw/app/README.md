# App Startup

Owns command-line parsing, process activation, single-instance handling,
PyInstaller runtime cleanup, splash startup, bootstrap reports, and CLI/GUI
dispatch. `cdmw_app.py` stays a thin executable wrapper around
`cdmw.app.bootstrap.main`.

Keep startup and process-lifetime behavior here. Do not import feature tabs or
feature workflow internals from bootstrap code. GUI startup crosses into the UI
through `cdmw/app/gui.py` and the public `cdmw.ui.main_window` facade.

External splash launch is nonblocking. `cdmw/core/startup_splash_protocol.py`
owns atomic command/artifact handling; app startup owns host monitoring,
background reaping, and bounded terminate/kill escalation.
