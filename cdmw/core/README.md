# Core

Owns low-level archive, DDS, texture workflow, package, catalog, research,
texture editor, native-helper integration, and compatibility orchestration that
has not moved to narrower packages yet.

Keep PySide widget code out of core. Preserve legacy public imports while moving
new policy to `cdmw/domain/`, coordination to `cdmw/services/`, long-running
execution to `cdmw/workers/`, mesh/material operations to `cdmw/modding/`, and
preview packaging to `cdmw/rendering/`.

`archive.py` and `archive_modding.py` are cached lazy compatibility facades.
Their explicit owner maps live in `archive_compat_exports*.py` and
`archive_modding_compat_exports*.py`; focused core modules import the mapped
owners directly and must never import either facade.

`archive_binary_preview.py` directly reexports binary-sidecar analysis and
corpus reporting from bounded `archive_binary_preview_{analysis,corpus}.py`
owners. Keep their output and cancellation contracts exact when decomposing
the remaining format decoders.

`temp_cache.py` owns process-local keyed build serialization and scoped cache
leases. Builders publish complete units before returning; readers hold a lease
while consuming paths, and pruning skips active or just-returned units.
