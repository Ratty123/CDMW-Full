# Texture Pipeline

Owns no-UI texture workflow helpers: runtime config, workspace paths, DDS/PNG
inspection, discovery, planning, preflight summaries, preview generation,
manifest tracking, logging, package export defaults, and cancellable native
DirectXTex execution through the bundled `cd-texture-dx.exe` helper.

Keep PySide controls and user interaction outside this package. Pure texture
rules belong in `cdmw/domain/textures/`; UI panels belong in
`cdmw/ui/texture_workflow/`; background execution belongs in services and
workers.
