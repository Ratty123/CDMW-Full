# Release Confidence Plan

Last reviewed: 2026-07-23

## Goal

Prove the completed phased restructure still imports, starts, packages, and
keeps core user workflows working behind stable facades.

## Read First

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/README.md`
3. `docs/architecture.md`
4. `docs/project-map.md`
5. `docs/test-matrix.md` when choosing validation
6. `docs/project-map-detailed.md` only when package boundaries are unclear

## Current Focus

- Preserve the completed repair baseline: compatibility facades, public imports,
  dependency direction, bounded owners, and the one-base composed `MainWindow`.
- Keep `docs/plans/active/` empty until new scoped implementation work starts.
- Keep normal/full QA headless; run licensed real-game proof only through the
  explicit local mesh gate.
- Use `$env:TEMP` for pytest `--basetemp`; never place QA output in the repo.

## Validation Order

1. Compile/import smoke over touched restructure surfaces and public facades.
2. Architecture guards:
   `tests/test_architecture_file_sizes.py`,
   `tests/test_architecture_public_facades.py`,
   `tests/test_architecture_import_boundaries.py`,
   `tests/test_architecture_no_wildcard_imports.py`.
3. Runtime/startup smoke from `docs/test-matrix.md`.
4. Focused archive, static replacement, texture, shell, worker, and packaging
   groups from `docs/test-matrix.md`.
5. Full suite only after focused groups are green or remaining failures are
   understood as external-data or environment problems.

## Done

- Relevant focused tests pass.
- Runtime/startup smoke passes.
- Packaging smoke passes or the exact blocker is documented.
- Remaining failures, if any, are classified with owner, command, and reason.

## Latest Validation

2026-08-14:

- **The two red drag gates are fixed and `-Area mesh` is 65 of 65.** Neither
  number they compared was wrong. The helper answers `tool_state` from the
  selection push it has already applied, and that trails the gesture by one, so
  asking once samples the selection before last. The product's own ordered trail
  at `workspace/logs/dotnet_protocol_current.jsonl` shows it directly: the
  `tool_state_applied` following the `selection_update` for request 8 still
  reported `last_host_selection_push.request_id: 4`, which was the projection
  probe's 39 vertices, while the session already held the gesture's 203. The
  harness recorded that 39 as the selection under test and the stroke deformed
  the 203, so both gates failed on a comparison between two different gestures.
  `_drive_projected_vertex_selection` now re-asks until the applied push has
  caught up with the newest `select_request` id, which takes two asks, and
  records the expected and applied ids, the attempt count and whether they
  converged. Afterwards selected and changed are the same
  `{submesh 1: 141, submesh 2: 62}`, and the projected screen delta is 40.0 px
  against a 40 px drag with 1.6e-13 px of error. `-Area mesh-unit` is 1,995
  passed with 1 skipped and `-Area smoke` passes.
- Every earlier explanation of these two gates reasoned from geometry and none
  survived a run. Recorded so they are not re-derived: the native brush was
  clipped to the session selection in `edit_topology_02.cpp`, which was built,
  gated, changed nothing and was reverted, because Move is a `transform` command
  and never takes the brush path; `selection_depth_mode` was confirmed to reach
  native correctly as `visible`; and the selection anchor was re-aimed at the
  settled pane, which moved it from 522.41 to 619.91 as intended and then
  selected nothing at all, since a click at 523 hits geometry and 622 misses it.
  That last result is the useful one: the roughly 98 px gap between the anchor
  and the host's selection centroid is two coordinate spaces describing one
  point, not an aiming error.
- The harness evidence trail in the run directory carries only helper-to-host
  events, which is why this ordering stayed invisible in it. The product-side
  trail carries both directions plus its own `host_decision` entries and is the
  cheaper first read for anything about who knew what when.

2026-08-13 (the **root-cause bullet immediately below is superseded** by the
2026-08-14 entry and is wrong; everything after it stands, including the
retraction it records, the run numbers, and the renderer status-payload defect,
which the fix above does not touch):

- **The two red drag gates fail because Move runs as a sculpt brush, not as a
  transform of the committed selection.** The ordered protocol trail settles it:
  `stroke_begin` and `stroke_end` both carry `tool=move`, `target_mode=vertex`,
  `operation=replace`, `radius=24`, `falloff=smooth`, `strength=0.5` and
  `scope_source_indices=[1, 2]`. The stroke therefore re-picks a brush footprint
  along the drag path and deforms that, so the committed 39-vertex selection in
  submesh 2 is not what moves and far more geometry does: 1,560 vertices,
  `{submesh 1: 1065, submesh 2: 495}`, in the run that produced this trail. That
  is `selected_geometry_only`. The same parameters explain
  `selected_projection_tracks_cursor`: a smooth falloff at strength 0.5 displaces
  the footprint's centre by a fraction of the cursor delta, measured at 14.36 px
  of a 40 px drag, or 36 %.
- An earlier entry here claimed the deformed set was a fixed 203 vertices
  invariant to the cursor. That was wrong and is retracted. It rested on three
  runs that happened to agree; a fourth run at the identical drag start produced
  1,560 changed vertices and a `[14.36, 0.0]` delta, so the outcome varies with
  what the brush sweeps rather than being fixed. The retraction matters because
  the invariance claim pointed at the projection probe's centre click as the
  culprit, and the trail shows the probe's selection is properly replaced: the
  authoritative `tool_state_applied` immediately before the stroke reports
  exactly `{submesh 2: 39}`.
- The aiming defect that hypothesis came from was real and is fixed. The
  projection probe ran while the embedded viewport was 1047 px wide, the viewport
  settles to 1242 px on the first real pointer input, and the press was dispatched
  about 97 px left of the selection; it now lands at 621 instead of 523, and the
  renderer's own `pane_bounds_diagnostics` confirms the stroke is measured against
  a 1242 px render surface. Fixing it was necessary but not sufficient.
- **The leftover-configuration hypothesis was tested and is wrong, and the
  contract question it raised is settled.** `cdmw/ui/mesh_editor/README.md` states
  the intended behaviour outright: Move requires an existing selection, and for
  the brush tools "native core restricts that brush to the resident selection when
  present". The gates assert the documented contract, so the defect is in the
  code, not in the gates.
- The brush parameters are not stale state from arming Select. `PointerPayload`
  in `MeshViewport.Input.cs` merges the editor's tool options into every stroke by
  design, and the scoping decision happens downstream. Sending a different
  `target_mode` cannot fix it either: the native rule at
  `native/cdmw_mesh_core/src/owners/edit_topology_02.cpp:149` reads
  `stroke_phase == "update" || stroke_phase == "end" || target_mode != "selection"`,
  so the brush wins on every update and end regardless of mode, and a stroke is
  almost entirely update and end phases.
- The restriction the README describes is implemented, and gated:
  `edit_topology_02.cpp:445` restricts the brush to the selection only when the
  item carries `selection_restricts_vertices`, which defaults to false. Only
  `cdmw/modding/mesh_native_brush.py` ever sets it, at three call sites. Two set
  it unconditionally; the third sets `selected is not None`.
- The failing path is the third. `cdmw/modding/mesh_edit_ops.py:871` falls back to
  `{index: None for index, _submesh in enumerate(mesh.submeshes)}` when the
  Python-side `MeshEditSelection` is empty, which sets
  `selection_restricts_vertices` false for every submesh and runs the brush
  unrestricted across the whole mesh. That matches every symptom: changes spanning
  submeshes the selection never touched, a count that varies with whatever the
  brush sweeps, and a selection that does not move as a unit.
- The selection is **not** empty, so that reading was wrong too. The host pushed
  it to the helper and the helper accepted it: `last_host_selection_push` records
  `accepted: true`, `offered_submeshes: [2]`, `offered_vertex_count: 39`. Both
  sides agree on the selection throughout.
- The defect is that the resident stroke path never asks for the restriction.
  `selection_restricts_vertices` is read in exactly one place,
  `edit_topology_02.cpp:445`, and written in exactly one file,
  `cdmw/modding/mesh_native_brush.py`, which serves the Python-side brush. A
  resident .NET stroke goes through the native editor session instead and never
  sets it, so `restrict_selection` is false, `allowed` is `nullptr`, and the brush
  is unrestricted for every resident stroke regardless of what is selected. Two
  independent rules therefore have to be wrong at once for this to work, and both
  are: `prefer_screen_brush` bypasses the session selection on update and end, and
  `allowed` is null so the brush is not clipped to it either.
- Every acknowledgement in the trail reports 1,560 changed items from the first
  update onward, not just at the end, which is what an unrestricted brush looks
  like from the first frame.
- The fix cannot simply feed `selected_vertices_from_edit_domains` into `allowed`.
  A resident stroke deliberately omits its selection payload on update and end
  and relies on the native session retaining it, so the item's domains are empty
  and restricting to them would move nothing at all. The restriction has to come
  from the editor session's own selection, which `edit_topology_02.cpp:165`
  already reads through `selected_vertex_weights_from_editor_session`. That is the
  next change, and it is native, so it carries a rebuild.
- A genuine product defect surfaced on the way: the renderer's status payload
  publishes a viewport rectangle that disagrees with the pane it renders and
  picks against. Measured here it reports 1047x1195 while its own
  `ActivePaneBounds` and Win32 `GetWindowRect` both report 1242x1195, so the
  status is the outlier of the three. Anything trusting that payload to aim at
  the pane is being misled, and the harness now records the disagreement as
  `status_disagreed_with_settled_pane` instead of inheriting it silently.
- The authorized real-game gate `scripts/codex_check.ps1 -Area mesh` ran against
  `character/model/1_pc/14_ptm/nude/cd_ptm_00_nude_00_0001.pac` after the PAC
  normal and eight-influence skin corrections. 63 of 65 gates passed, including
  `renderer_backend_ok` (`d3d11_vortice_shader`), `edit_backend_ok`
  (`cdmw_mesh_core_0.1`), `no_synthetic_fallback`, `real_textures_bound_and_decoded`,
  `real_pac_geometry_display_modes`, every material and presentation gate,
  `exact_topology_rebuild`, `exact_topology_rebuild_no_fallback`, and
  `source_archives_unchanged`. Source PAMT/PAZ fingerprints were byte-identical
  before and after, verified again after the second run below.
- The two failures, `selected_geometry_only` and `selected_projection_tracks_cursor`,
  are the drag gates already recorded as known-red and inherited from `main`. That
  was confirmed rather than assumed: the identical gate was rerun at the branch
  base `cdb96302` and produced the same two failures with identical numbers, 203
  changed vertices against a 39-vertex selection, `{1: 141, 2: 62}` changed by
  submesh, a `[0.0, 0.0]` projected screen delta, and 40.0 px projection error.
  A drag moves geometry outside the selection and the selection's projected centre
  does not follow the cursor; neither path reads a normal or a skin row.
- The exact LOD0 topology serializer behaved as its contract requires.
  `delete_faces_topology` rebuilt exactly, 3,784 to 3,783 faces, with
  `fallback_used: false`, `protected_bytes_preserved: true`,
  `original_bounds_preserved: true`, `lower_lods_preserved: true`, and
  `max_absolute_quantization_error: 0.0` over 13,161 direct vertices.
  `loop_cut_topology` and `subdivide_midpoint_topology` were both refused with
  `TOPOLOGY_PROTECTED_BYTES_DIVERGE` and wrote no output, so
  `blended_skin_path_proven` remains false. That is the fail-closed rule working:
  bytes 6-7 are identified but not derivable, so a derived vertex on stock
  geometry is refused rather than approximated.
- Evidence is licensed-game derived and stays under system TEMP, never in the
  repository: run `42b44795555c4c0ab566e72df487f35e` for the branch and
  `96e455116da54c0fa4905e543b656e98` for the base comparison, each holding
  `result.json`, `evidence_report.json`, the rendered captures, the rebuilt LOD0
  PAC, and the editable export.
- Dated material-audit totals moved here from `docs/ai/PROJECT_MEMORY.md`, which
  keeps durable rules rather than completion logs. The 120-PAC material
  classification audit moved from 99 PASS / 4 CONCERN / 17 FAIL to 119/1/0 after
  repair, its one remaining concern being sword 004's localized guard
  tint/material region. A fifth 120-PAC material-first audit excluding all 317
  prior-evidence paths finalized at 120/0/0 after direct review of all 720 paired
  views, finding no new shared defect across swords, shields, other weapons,
  helmets, full armor slots, hair/beard, skin, fur, bone, crystal, organic shell,
  and unusual mixed creatures; visually ambiguous pale mask 091 was confirmed by
  its extracted contract as dominant metal. Evidence:
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260717-fifth-material-classification-120`.
- The 2026-07-22 source-fidelity v2 run at
  `cdmw-material-parity-final-120-20260720-111535` completed 3,558/3,558 direct
  original-detail inspections with clean path/hash integrity and finalized at
  120 PASS / 0 CONCERN / 0 FAIL across 1,359 regions. Forty-one of 42 parked rows
  cleared against source/region/PAC state; the one real defect was textureless
  generic base tint incorrectly gated by zero blend strength, fixed by honoring
  explicit `MaterialBaseTint.w` and directly recaptured on spear-0057 with a
  textured control unchanged. Native DDS source-board previews (21 rows) and
  hair/fur anisotropy/flow (68 rows) remain explicit unchanged unsupported
  features; no licensed real-game proof was run.
- Exact cold `cd_pgm_00_nude_00_0001.pac` external material synthesis fell from
  5.103 s to 1.812 s, against an earlier 93.214 s baseline.
- Representative hair PAC `cd_ptm_00_hair_00_0003.pac` must resolve at least one
  source DDS; prepared audit packages own and rewrite every nested selectable
  `source_path`, including non-direct candidates, so cache eviction cannot
  invalidate capture.

2026-07-23:

- Full catalogue-v2 cache construction was benchmarked against the authorized
  129.76 GiB game corpus: 213 archive sources and 1,674,732 entries on a Ryzen 7
  9800X3D, 32 GiB RAM, and NVMe source/cache drives. From the pre-change Release
  baseline to the final self-contained worker, time to the first 64-row page
  changed from 10.309 s to 4.604 s for an empty cache and from 8.701 s to
  3.830 s for forced refresh; the five-run cached median remained effectively
  instant at 0.065 s. Native sorting fell from 3.425 s to 0.787 s. Cold and
  refresh `archive.ali`/`archive.adi` outputs matched the baseline byte-for-byte
  by SHA-256, and every worker stopped cleanly.
- The authoritative Full backend Release gate passed its native CTest, zero-
  warning .NET build, 14 managed scenarios, and synthetic QProcess protocol
  probe. The focused remote backend set passed 92 tests and the broader Archive
  area passed 113 tests. This run did not build the complete Full application
  package or perform visible UI proof.

2026-07-22:

- The single-renderer migration is complete through `9aed552`. Archive Browser,
  reference preview, Material Sidecar, attachment placement, Model Library,
  static replacement/alignment, icon capture, and Mesh Editor now share the
  resident .NET/Vortice host. The retired native renderer project, executable,
  HWND/WM_COPYDATA protocol, fallback startup, and packaged payload are absent;
  the release spec rejects any reintroduced `cdmw-d3d11-preview.exe`.
- The final nonvisual suite was split into six bounded file groups because the
  desktop shell has a shorter effective command ceiling than the complete
  suite. All groups passed on the final working tree: 5,976 tests passed, 5
  skipped, 1 deselected, and 337 subtests passed. The authoritative follow-up
  checks passed with Archive 113/113 and Mesh Unit 910/911 with one expected
  skip. The HKX Rust crate passed 24/24 tests, and the rebuilt Release mesh core
  passed its focused native selection/decomposition coverage.
- Release validation built the self-contained .NET helper with zero warnings or
  errors, passed material-resource policy, Material Authority parity, hidden
  sparse GPU soak, canonical 144 Hz pacing, dependency pins, and both onedir and
  onefile packaging checks. Both package forms included the verified .NET helper
  and excluded the retired renderer. These are hidden/synthetic renderer and
  packaging results; no new visible licensed real-PAC or Full-app proof was run
  or claimed for this migration.

2026-07-17:

- A fifth hidden material-first audit added 120 real PACs while excluding all
  317 paths in the prior evidence ledger. Its 40 weapons (16 swords and eight
  shields), 52 armor items (20 helmets), eight body/head controls, ten
  hair/beard controls, and 12 unusual assets produced 720 paired views. Every
  image was inspected after classifying the visible material and the ledger
  finalized at 120 PASS / 0 CONCERN / 0 FAIL with zero unreviewed. Evidence:
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260717-fifth-material-classification-120`.
- Run `875c065c8a9b4005849f125621272d9b` parsed 428 submeshes,
  878,512 vertices, and 1,043,787 faces. Cloth, leather, fur, hair, skin, bone,
  feather, organic shell, and stone controls remained matte; response on mixed
  items stayed localized to visible plate and hardware. A pale mask that looked
  superficially like ivory was checked against its extracted source contract
  and correctly retained its dominant authored metal response.
- Archive Browser and production `d3d11_vortice_shader` capture batches,
  rendered-camera integrity, and all before/after PAMT/PAZ fingerprints passed.
  One resident device/viewport captured all 120 scenes with no reset or restart.
  Focused audit/material validation passed 121 tests; .NET Release built with
  zero warnings/errors; material-resource policy returned `ok: true`; and
  `mesh-unit` passed 902 tests with 1 skip. The full-scale hidden GPU soak passed
  at `0.2111 ms` handler p95 and `59.9553` updates/s. The 30-second 144 Hz proof
  captured 4,316 frames at `143.865` FPS with `7.3750 ms` p95 and zero resets.
  Visible/licensed real-game proof was not run or claimed.
- A fourth hidden material-classification audit added 120 real PACs with no
  overlap against the previous 197 unique paths: 40 weapons (16 swords and
  eight shields), 52 armor items (20 helmets), eight body/head controls, ten
  hair/beard controls, and 12 unusual mixed-material assets. All 720 paired
  views were inspected after classifying visible material and mixed regions.
  Original run `8e03f569ddaf47378d3f1e8d9c067e7d` finalized at
  99 PASS / 4 CONCERN / 17 FAIL; repaired run
  `5e60be0453064ad7a27d1741ad1c184e` finalized at
  119 PASS / 1 CONCERN / 0 FAIL with zero unreviewed. Evidence:
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260717-fourth-material-classification-120`
  and
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260717-fourth-material-classification-after-repair-120`.
- The shared repair decodes older standard `_sp` maps as direct G roughness and
  B metal/specular response, requires dominant decoded metal before promoting
  an armor submesh to global metal, and retains localized metal per pixel on
  mixed cloth/leather assets. Sparse inferred beard alpha now preserves the
  card when cutoff would discard at least 90% of the decoded texture; explicit
  authored cutout authority remains unchanged. The one remaining concern is
  sword 004's localized guard tint/material-region mismatch.
- The audit review schema now requires explicit visual material classification
  for this corpus. Slot names do not imply metal: footwear 082's stitched pale
  shafts were classified as cloth or soft leather, its dark cuffs as leather,
  and only small trim/hardware as metal. Matte soft material is treated as
  correct when it matches Archive Browser.
- A full recapture exposed offscreen resizing recreating an Archive-audit
  camera through the interactive basis. Capture now preserves the source
  camera world matrix and rebuilds only its projection; all six rendered-view
  integrity checks pass. Both production renderer windows remained hidden and
  resident, all 25 PAMT/PAZ sources stayed byte-identical, and there were zero
  restarts or device resets.
- Fresh focused validation passed 121 tests; .NET Release built with zero
  warnings/errors; the material-resource-policy report passed; and `mesh-unit`
  passed 901 tests with 1 skip. The hidden 1,000,000-vertex/1,000-update soak
  passed at `0.2001 ms` handler p95 and `59.9617` updates/s. The 30-second
  144 Hz proof captured 4,317 frames at `143.85` effective FPS with
  `7.1480 ms` p95, hidden windows, and zero resets. Visible/licensed real-game
  proof was not run or claimed.
- The hidden material-parity audit expanded to 162 unique real PACs across
  swords and other weapons, shields, helmets, armor, boots, facial composites,
  hair/fur, creatures, props, glass, emissive, and unusual mixed materials.
  This was 156 additions plus six repeat controls, with all 972 paired views
  and 162 contact sheets directly inspected. Runs
  `ca91cfb0404c4e4086ecedd514231176` and
  `dc093f2063e347a1acb1bc3272a4af6a` finalized at a combined 136 PASS,
  24 CONCERN, and 2 FAIL. Evidence:
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260717-physical-metal-current-90` and
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260717-physical-metal-current-72`.
- That larger corpus exposed two shared defects missed by the earlier
  15-model proof: the physical metal path could suppress source readability
  and over-amplify chromatic tint, and anonymous inferred hair/cutout batches
  used the generic `0.5` cutoff. The repair restores a bounded source floor and
  Archive Browser tint authority, applies the established `0.12` inferred
  cutoff while preserving explicit authority, and retains custom manifests in
  generated audit rerun commands.
- Fresh alpha proof finalized at 6 PASS, 2 CONCERN, 0 FAIL, with rejected facial
  cards restored and no control halos. Fresh 50-PAC post-fix proof finalized at
  43 PASS, 7 CONCERN, 0 FAIL after direct review of all 300 paired views. Every
  sword, other weapon, shield, helmet, upper-armor, and hair control passed.
  Residuals are three asset-specific packed roughness/normal contracts, two
  unsupported `skinnedmeshtear` layer graphs, and two smaller facial-card
  density/color differences. Evidence:
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260717-alpha-cutoff-repair-8` and
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260717-final-material-parity-50`.
- The 12-module focused suite passed 129 tests; the .NET Release build passed
  with zero warnings/errors; material resource policy passed; and `mesh-unit`
  passed 890 tests with 1 skip. The hidden 1,000,000-vertex/1,000-update soak
  passed with `0.1804 ms` handler p95 and zero restarts/resets. The 30-second
  144 Hz proof captured 4,317 frames at `143.869` effective FPS with `7.2341 ms`
  p95, no frame over `20.83 ms`, and zero restarts/resets. All audit runs passed
  integrity and retained byte-identical archive fingerprints. Visible/licensed
  real-game proof was not run or claimed.

2026-07-16:

- The physical colored-metal follow-up replaced the flat grayscale metal
  environment and suppressed Fresnel path with RGB warm/cool environment
  radiance, Schlick Fresnel, and GGX/Smith direct response while retaining
  source-colored F0. The hidden textured-metal proof is now v4 and adds four
  same-material specular-debug camera captures. Its fresh smoke passed every
  response/completeness/bounds gate with `0.7050` all-view luma ratio,
  `27.847` specular mean span, and zero white fraction.
- The identical 15-PAC sword/axe/helmet/armor/boots baseline and current-code
  runs are complete. Current run `50ec9b59d53d4d8fa5b68beb39fd4373`
  finalized at 15 PASS, 0 CONCERN, 0 FAIL across 90 directly inspected paired
  views. One hidden production process/device/viewport handled all 15 resident
  loads with zero restarts/resets, and all 17 referenced PAMT/PAZ fingerprints
  remained byte-identical. Evidence:
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260716-metallic-equipment-15-after/summary.json`
  and the adjacent `review.md`.
- OpenImageIO 3.1.15.0 produced 36 exact same-camera baseline/current reports
  and 36 amplified diff PNGs for representative gold sword, axe, helmet, two
  armor assets, and promoted-metal boots. All comparisons executed with zero
  blockers and zero camera-matrix mismatches. The nonmetal hard-surface control
  remained effectively stable at average RMS `0.000276` and maximum error
  `0.007843`; intended metal assets changed without object clipping. Evidence
  is under the current-code root at `evidence/oiio-before-after/`.
- Immutable external material factors are now resolved once per synthesized
  texture instead of once per pixel. Deterministic 96x96 synthesis improved
  from `6400.52 ms` to `33.99 ms` with identical output hashes; Red Knight
  package time fell from `459.47 s` to `21.56 s`. The .NET Release build passed
  with zero warnings/errors, the full hidden 1,000,000-vertex/1,000-update soak
  passed with `0.1647 ms` handler p95 and zero working-set growth, and
  `mesh-unit` passed 889 tests with 1 skip. Visible/licensed real-game proof was
  not run or claimed.

2026-07-15:

- A material-operator follow-up recaptured the `.NET/Vortice` side of the same
  90-PAC corpus under run ID
  `d3cd9425cb414256be2bf8092bc022c4` with a truly hidden production
  HWND: neither host nor viewport was shown or visible. The 90 new Mesh Editor
  captures were paired with the original Archive Browser captures at the same
  six angles, producing 540 comparisons. One .NET process/device/viewport
  served all 90 resident scene loads with zero resets. The completed direct
  review improved the prior 27 PASS / 31 CONCERN / 32 FAIL baseline to 79 PASS /
  10 CONCERN / 1 FAIL with zero unreviewed rows. Integrity, camera mapping,
  composite completeness, and before/after fingerprints for all referenced
  PAMT/PAZ files passed. Evidence:
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260715-native-material-consistency-90/hidden-paired-90/summary.json`
  and the adjacent `review.md`.
- Native and .NET material operators now agree on source-stable nonmetal
  Fresnel, actual drawn metal-category authority, authoritative RGB versus
  scalar-mask emissive inputs, and omitted-versus-explicit-zero material hints.
  The live UI/native protocol preserves the same authority and scalar-mask
  fields, including direct BC4 emissive provenance. Malformed emissive colors
  cannot accidentally promote the fallback blue tint. The paired visual pass
  reused the original prepared packages. The hidden production GPU gate proves
  the drawn metal-category and resident material-update path; the RGB-versus-BC4
  emissive authority branches have parser, protocol, package, shader-source, and
  clean Release-build coverage, not fresh pixel-producing GPU comparison proof.
- No x-ray, transparency, global culling, or depth regression was reproduced in
  the 540 reviewed pairs. The sparse 036 jacket and standalone 057 body, 064
  harpy, and 069 upper-body retain the same open-card or boundary layout as
  Archive while remaining opaque and depth-tested. Model 081 retains a
  view-dependent inner-brazier visibility concern, but it is not evidence of a
  global x-ray mode. The remaining FAIL is 070, whose collar is purple in
  Archive but cream/white in Vortice; the remaining concerns are bounded tint,
  emissive-hue, roughness/normal, or low-exposure auditability differences.
- End-state validation reported 626 focused service/UI/package tests plus 75
  subtests passed, 85 shader/audit tests plus 3 subtests passed, and the final
  `mesh-unit` rerun reported 836 passed and 1 skipped. The Release .NET and native D3D11 builds
  passed, the native self-test passed, and the hidden full-scale production GPU
  soak remained release-gate eligible. These captures establish CDMW renderer
  consistency only; they are not licensed real-game parity proof and do not
  prove animation timing or rendered deformation.
- The non-overlapping visual/material follow-up audited 72 unique read-only
  PACs: 10 shields, 5 swords, 14 outfits, 5 bodies, 8 head/face assets,
  10 hair/fur assets, 8 spiders, 6 glass/alpha controls, and 6 unusual props.
  Archive Browser and the production `.NET/Vortice` renderer each captured
  72/72 assets at six paired angles. Direct inspection classified 15 PASS,
  40 CONCERN, and 17 FAIL with no unreviewed rows. One native process and one
  .NET process/device/viewport stayed resident, with zero restarts or device
  resets and 72 resident scene loads. Before/after archive fingerprints were
  identical at
  `0947119118ACBBAFD8555E9BFBEFEA9DC8D453E2FF712CA35F0660EC28D7BAC7`.
  Evidence:
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260715-final-72/summary.json` and
  `workspace/mesh-editor-visual-audit/20260715-final-72/review.md`.
- Shared repairs moved expensive material composition into the cancellable
  package worker, preserved raw diagnostics and exact native material batches,
  and stopped resident state snapshots from synthesizing images. Audit package
  stabilization now recursively owns and rewrites every `source_path` that the
  native role scan can select, including nested specular/detail descriptors and
  non-direct candidates. A fresh capture-only rerun then completed in 77.3
  seconds with no missing selectable texture sources.
- The corpus did not close shield-layer, outfit palette/dye, generic
  packed-mask, dark-fur, or combined cloth/hair/standard spider graphs. It did
  not contain a true transmissive alpha-blend glass shader; all six glass/alpha
  rows were opaque or cutout controls. Hair/fur anisotropy, full skin response,
  separately composed head/face behavior, visual animation playback, and
  deformation remain outside this static renderer-consistency audit. The
  separate animation/rigging smokes prove parser, binding, and in-memory pose
  changes only, not game timing or rendered deformation.
- Final verification reported 805 passed and 1 skipped from `mesh-unit`; the
  focused visual-audit harness/package group reported 17 passed, and the
  Release .NET build completed with zero warnings and zero errors. Architecture
  hard limits pass. The eight originally oversized repair owners are all below
  800 lines and absent from the size baseline, so the prior "eight stale files"
  description is resolved. The repository-wide ratchet remains red on 12 other
  pre-existing/concurrent file-growth entries, 10 new oversized functions, and
  5 grown oversized functions; none is an owner introduced or left oversized
  by this visual-audit goal.

2026-07-14:

- The angle-stability follow-up removed view-dependent material recoloring from
  both production preview shaders. Identical-material camera sweeps reduced
  maximum chromaticity drift from 0.1670 to 0.0097, kept all-view mean luma
  within a 0.8245 ratio, and produced no near-white clipping. The release-scale
  hidden Vortice gate passed at 1,000,000 vertices and 1,000 paced updates with
  0.1908 ms handler p95. Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-dotnet-gpu-sparse-soak-angle-color-final.json`.
- The reported `cd_phm_02_sword_0014.pac` handle now rejects its proven
  wrong-family generic layer as visible albedo, falls back to the decoded gold
  material tint, and retains the same-family normal/material maps. Direct-slot
  manifest parsing also prevents a nested normal-map `base` field from being
  rebound as albedo. The exact package loaded six batches with five intended
  base textures and no handle-normal-as-base binding; 109 focused tests and
  `mesh-unit` (729 passed, 1 skipped) passed. The visible production
  `.NET/Vortice` real-PAC gate preserved one resident package/process, reported
  zero reloads/restarts, and left every PAMT/PAZ fingerprint unchanged.
  Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-dotnet-7415cb44a2b047e1b3539b1f010d13b9\evidence_report.json`.
- The user-reported black fully-metallic/two-sided preview regression is closed
  by production-shader environment response, backface tangent-frame correction,
  and a linear-middle-gray contrast pivot. The pre-fix identical-camera proof
  recorded zero front and oblique luma; the release-scale hidden Vortice gate
  now keeps front/back mean luma within 0.1%, retains textured oblique detail,
  and passes at 1,000,000 vertices plus 1,000 paced updates (59.9692 updates/s,
  0.1918 ms handler p95). Evidence: `%TEMP%\cdmw-dotnet-metal-baseline.json`
  and `%TEMP%\cdmw-dotnet-gpu-sparse-soak.json`.
- The exact authorized Wolf Gravestone ZIP import passed, its corpus row retained
  base/packed-material/normal semantics plus the explicit unsupported sorted
  alpha-blend flag, and the runtime resource-policy probe passed. `mesh-unit`
  reported 725 passed and 1 skipped. The canonical visible real-PAC
  `.NET/Vortice` gate then passed with three native DDS bindings, a stable
  resident process/package, 0.5730 ms stroke-handler p95, and unchanged source
  payload plus PAMT/PAZ hashes. Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-mesh-material-profile-corpus.json`,
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-material-resource-policy-runtime.json`, and
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-dotnet-8d3848e45e974221a6f14aaf72560ca4\evidence_report.json`.
- Read-only inspection of the reported original
  `cd_phm_02_sword_0014.pac` found six opaque batches and no source transparency
  contract; five batches are fully metallic, which directly exercises the fixed
  black-metal path. Its gold/emissive tints are source-derived. Exact game-layer
  parity remains unclaimed because one handle-layer texture choice is marked
  wrong-family and the package reports `material_quality_safe=false`. Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw_user_sword_native_evidence_iadim4ll\package\manifest.json`.
- The remaining material-risk follow-up passed all 73 production real-PAC gates.
  Two linked Texture Editor strokes regenerated a 12-level editable BGRA chain
  from a 12-mip native source; the canonical topology/UV/undo/redo/export flow
  settled with one PID, zero reloads/restarts, and unchanged PAMT/PAZ hashes.
  Evidence: `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-dotnet-377f9781878941c4a27091a8dfe506dd\evidence_report.json`.
- The full hidden Vortice gate passed at 1,000,000 vertices and 1,000 updates
  with 59.9752 effective updates/second, 0.2247 ms handler p95, and no failed
  gates. `mesh-unit` reported 722 passed and 1 skipped; the focused material,
  mip, evidence, and corpus tests passed, as did the Release build and runtime
  material-policy report. Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-dotnet-gpu-sparse-soak-risk-followup-20260714.json` and
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-material-resource-policy-risk-followup-20260714.json`.
- The bounded real-game corpus now uses
  `cd_ptm_00_hair_00_0003.pac` for hair and requires it to resolve a source DDS.
  The current game data resolves one DXT5 resource with 11 mips; the seven-asset
  game-only corpus fingerprint is
  `639459e0349d3d347666248f97df588ff1b05181d07457cef6786c2f32e41b7d`.
  Evidence: `%TEMP%\cdmw-material-fidelity-corpus-risk-followup-20260714.json`.

2026-07-13:

- Material-fidelity hardening passed the production .NET/Vortice real-PAC gate
  with native BC1 sRGB uploads preserving 11-12 source mips for all three
  canonical DDS resources and zero native-upload fallbacks. The same resident
  PID/HWND, one package/process, zero reload/restart, and unchanged PAMT/PAZ
  hashes were proven. Deterministic 512x512 capture comparison changed 7,101
  pixels; foreground mean luma rose from 30.42 to 62.77 and the below-25 dark
  fraction fell from 47.23% to 0.26% while the dark workbench background stayed
  stable. The bounded corpus now contains body, clothing, hair, weapon, prop,
  layered armor, fur, and external-model rows (fingerprint
  `5cca4652c9bb50620b1d5022ada731732ea3cc58e102a1ecb69c7d0d7670c619`).
  Evidence: `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-dotnet-1d5a55496ece49ff839d90b62f796823\evidence_report.json`,
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-material-fidelity-before-after-20260713.json`, and
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-material-fidelity-corpus-after-20260713.json`.
- The resident .NET/Vortice repair implementation closed all 18 source defects
  with owning behavior/protocol tests. `mesh-unit` reported 704 passed and 1
  skipped. A direct full run reported 5,302 passed, 6 skipped, and 3 intentional
  deselections. `run_full_qa.ps1` then completed in 1,026.3 seconds, including
  canonical full pytest, compileall, dependency checks, `cd_hkx` format/tests,
  production helper publication, hidden GPU proof, a clean temporary onedir
  build, packaged helper GPU proof, and packaged startup smoke.
- The canonical real nude-PAC proof passed all 72 gates through
  `d3d11_vortice_shader` and `cdmw_mesh_core_0.1`. It bound three archive DDS
  textures, changed only 12 selected vertices over 40 physical updates, recorded
  0.5038 ms handler p95 and 38.8021 ms maximum heartbeat gap, produced a 16,744
  pixel material difference, completed topology/UV/material/texture/undo/export/
  readback, and preserved every PAMT/PAZ hash. Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-dotnet-7b829aea6dc94e998630a809543125ef\evidence_report.json`.
- The final full-scale hidden Vortice soak passed with one million vertices,
  1,000 sparse updates plus 64 warmups, 59.9742 effective updates/second,
  0.2084 ms handler p95, 0.4659 ms maximum, and zero post-warmup growth. Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-mesh-editor-resident-repair-20260713-004343\dotnet-gpu-sparse-soak-final.json`.
- External import proof passed against the authorized sword ZIP; the focused
  real-game test reported 1 passed. The material corpus covers 20 declared
  policy profiles, two hashed actual assets, and three failure cases with corpus
  fingerprint `46a6af2113ca7c7d6543d628c7b0590c87f4fbce20c45ce104372221ff4eecf5`.
- Current-worktree release builds and their startup/helper verification passed
  again after the final packaged-UI repairs. The onefile artifact is
  183,141,243 bytes, SHA-256
  `87841F35E7F62EDA635777E778B4FE1F8DA99462B8D5EAF1098C4C6E85C798CC`.
  The onedir EXE is 16,460,434 bytes, SHA-256
  `A04A317C09EFDAE30D56462793055D5CFFCB397AF6388165D5378DE75A2B458D`.
  Its bundled helper SHA-256 is
  `A9BCADB48CC5BC330162CEF9C789BCAB8341DC1C4F59E6235133D88B891F45B4`,
  and the helper-manifest file SHA-256 is
  `96BE3BBFB041A8A902E7106A030C0C821D83D9C37D0138B04C556FC4FDE099F6`.
- Computer Use completed the real packaged Mesh Editor workflow in both release
  modes against
  `character/model/1_pc/14_ptm/nude/cd_ptm_00_nude_00_0001.pac` after loading
  the 1,674,731-entry archive cache. Onedir rendered separate Original and
  Imported/Modify views. The final clean artifact was exercised from an
  authorized temporary copy and kept helper PID 21620 across Edit Mesh, Finish
  Edit Mesh, and placement; the preceding full control pass also proved
  immediate edit-mode re-entry without reload. Runtime evidence recorded
  `mesh_dotnet_edit_mode_finished_resident` with process generation 1 and no
  deactivation/provenance-block event. Select All and Clear Selection produced
  visible acknowledged selection changes. The embedded Advanced section opened
  inside the Builder with no orphan window. Onefile repeated the real-PAC
  Builder/helper smoke with helper PID 28236 and recorded
  `mesh_dotnet_helper_provenance_verified` from its `_MEI` extraction.
- The visible pass exposed and closed three packaged-only defects: Builder
  factory read-before-assignment plus an orphan parentless Advanced section,
  false helper-provenance rejection after an already verified
  `protocol_ready`, and Finish Edit Mesh hiding the resident helper and leaving
  a blank viewport. The final `mesh-unit` gate reported 706 passed and 1
  skipped; focused resident-finish/true-close/busy-stroke review reported 20
  passed. Both Builders were cancelled, `Build Mod` was never invoked, no game
  archive was written, and both applications shut down without helper orphans.
- The full-suite runtime smoke exposed and closed an Item Icons worker teardown
  race: finished Python workers now return to the UI thread before their QThread
  quits, and both objects are defer-deleted only after nonblocking native teardown
  confirmation. Focused Item Icons/output/runtime/documentation coverage reported
  26 passed. The completed active plan was removed from `docs/plans/active/`.

2026-07-12:

- Mesh selection and harness-truth fixes passed the final canonical sequence.
  `mesh-unit` reported 680 passed; full headless QA reported 5,169 passed,
  5 skipped, and 2 intentional visual/real-game deselections. The .NET Release
  build completed with zero warnings/errors, and size ratchets pass with
  `real_dotnet.py` reduced to 716 lines behind the 143-line physical-input owner.
- The explicit nude-PAC proof passed all 70 gates through renderer
  `d3d11_vortice_shader` and edit backend `cdmw_mesh_core_0.1`. It bound three
  real archive textures, proved foreground-visible renderer PID ownership for
  every capture/input, exercised textured/untextured-face/vertex views, delivered
  40 physical drag updates, completed paint/assignment/UV/topology/undo/export/
  readback, proved initial/no-part and face-without-part selection, recorded
  0.6332 ms handler p95 and 50.06 ms maximum heartbeat gap, and preserved every
  PAMT/PAZ hash. Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-dotnet-fe7c05b56b0c41949d6d011561ec0140\evidence_report.json`.
- Release onedir packaging passed with 471 files/447,385,055 bytes. The EXE
  SHA-256 is `D1F426BF80AE74EFA28A521E13FE19E09BC13E5DE226CD0DED5CBB585641F643`;
  the bundled .NET helper SHA-256 is
  `203D9822D54861910D1134C4D5F629D0738ADC5F2446C82AC3C3C4B2E6D3C542`.
  Packaged and installed startup reached `post_construction`; installed hidden
  Mesh Editor lazy-target smoke passed. Against the installed build and actual
  1,674,731-entry archive cache, Archive Browser reached ready in 2.529 s, then
  canonicalized `All files.pac`, searched `Nude`, returned 75 results in 1.157 s,
  and closed cleanly. Installed real-PAC UI verification proved no initial part
  selection, vertex/face selection without a Parts-row selection, Clear
  Selection, and blank-list clearing of part highlight; shutdown was clean and
  all source archive hashes remained unchanged.
- Full resumable corpora completed. The external catalogue classified all 800
  models and all 418 ZIP members (`corpus_ok=true`, zero unclassified). The
  archive-backed PAC_XML audit classified all 12,886 entries, reported zero
  read/parse errors or crashes, preserved every source archive fingerprint, and
  finished with `ok=true`. Evidence remains under `%TEMP%` as
  `cdmw-external-model-audit-resident-goal.json` and
  `cdmw-pac-xml-audit-resident-goal.{json,csv}`.
- The latest recorded hidden .NET soak covered one million vertices and 1,000
  sparse updates at 59.96 Hz, 0.2024 ms handler p95, and 0.16% post-warmup RSS
  growth, with one initial full build and passing tail-shrink/material-lineage
  proof.
- The Phase 6 startup benchmark passed against
  `docs/reference/app-startup-benchmark-phase5.json`: public import p95 was
  197.077 ms with no forbidden heavy modules, first-window p95 was 1746.569 ms
  (31.258% better than baseline), first-tab p95 was 233.923 ms, and helper-ready
  p95 was 517.075 ms. Result:
  `docs/reference/app-startup-benchmark-phase6.json`.

2026-07-11:

- Test/tool relevance audit passed: all 389 test modules and 5,114 tests collect;
  canonical nonvisual QA reported 5,107 passed, 5 skipped, and 2 intentional
  visual deselections. The 68-module tool-facing gate reported 960 passed,
  1 environment skip, and 2 visual deselections. Python compile coverage now
  includes `tools`; the production .NET/Vortice helper built with zero warnings
  or errors and passed hidden smoke on `d3d11_vortice_shader`. Redundant Research
  facade behavior tests were replaced by an all-export identity contract, while
  unique owner behavior stayed covered. Configured `codex_check` area paths now
  fail closed instead of silently skipping missing tests.
- Resident editor/import risk completion passed its final sequence. Clean
  headless QA reported 5,110 passed, 5 skipped, and 2 intentional visual
  deselections; `mesh-unit` reported 679 passed. Native helpers and Release
  .NET built with zero warnings/errors.
- The current hidden Vortice soak passed one million vertices and 1,000 sparse
  updates at 59.96 Hz, 0.205 ms handler p95, zero post-warmup RSS growth, and
  passing partial tail-shrink/material-lineage checks. The canonical nude-PAC
  proof passed all 67 gates, including real textured, neutral untextured-face,
  wire-plus-vertices, and vertices-only captures; its handler p95 was 0.637 ms
  and maximum heartbeat gap 36.4 ms. It completed paint/assign/UV/topology/
  undo/export/readback and preserved every source hash. Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-dotnet-f1ecd54552534d918ec61fa885ab24cd\evidence_report.json`.
- External catalogue evidence accounts for 800/800 sources with 739 supported,
  22 review-required, 39 safely blocked, zero unclassified, and zero corpus
  crashes. PAC_XML evidence accounts for 12,886/12,886 archive entries with
  6,046 supported, 6,840 review-required, zero errors/crashes/unclassified,
  and 55 actual source archives unchanged before/after.
- Current-source fast onedir packaging passed with 488 files/447,445,766 bytes.
  `CrimsonDesertModWorkbench.exe` is 16,359,452 bytes, SHA-256
  `31F5871AA94CF2F403CAC6DB8072C7C370FA6D61FA7D7CB536FFAE953B027DA4`;
  packaged startup reached `post_construction`, and the bundled self-contained
  Vortice helper passed hidden GPU smoke.
- The reviewed resident-editor/Material Authority follow-up passed its final
  gates. Integrated focused coverage reported 597 passed, 39 subtests, and two
  intentional visual deselections; `mesh-unit` reported 675 passed; the full
  headless suite reported 4,976 passed, 5 skipped, and 2 deselected in
  1,086.55 seconds. Architecture/import-order/docs coverage, Python compile,
  dependency pins, Rust tests, native builds, and .NET Release build all passed.
- The full-QA wrapper exposed a real false-negative after that passing suite:
  PowerShell `Start-Process -PassThru` returned a process object without a
  readable exit code. `Invoke-QAStep` now starts and owns one
  `System.Diagnostics.Process`, preserves exact nonzero codes, and retains
  timeout/process-tree cleanup. Four QA-runner behavior tests pass. The
  remaining helper, PyInstaller, packaged hidden-GPU, and post-construction
  startup steps were resumed and passed.
- The final hidden Vortice soak passed one million vertices and 1,000 updates
  at 8.102 ms handler p95 with zero post-warmup RSS growth, one initial full
  build, and one affected-batch topology rebuild. Atomic position/normal/UV
  packets, malformed/incomplete rejection, part add/remove/reindex, and
  material-lineage proofs passed.
- Release onefile packaging and post-construction startup passed with both
  `cdmw.ui.shell.window_bootstrap_state` and `cdmw.core.ncnn_model_catalog`
  collected. Artifact:
  `dist/CrimsonDesertModWorkbench-0.10.0-alpha.2-windows-portable.exe`,
  182,649,463 bytes, SHA-256
  `0132F6288F44456DB81A0470A9C08ABC8567F7A10C11CB65659255FB286CC910`.
- The explicit production nude-PAC gate passed again. It bound three real
  archive textures, changed only 12 selected vertices, kept PID/HWND and the
  viewport stationary, recorded 1.624 ms handler p95 and 94.048 ms maximum
  heartbeat gap, applied resident material updates without package/process/SRV
  churn, and left PAMT/PAZ hashes unchanged. Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-dotnet-1f183f23c9f04de8bbcdeecf4e6ea7c9\evidence_report.json`.
- Canonical headless full QA passed: 4,865 passed, 5 skipped, 2 deselected in
  893.46 seconds. Visual and licensed `real_game` scenarios remained opt-in.
- Release onedir packaging passed at
  `dist/CrimsonDesertModWorkbench-0.10.0-alpha.2-windows`: 447,014,232 bytes
  across 488 files. `CrimsonDesertModWorkbench.exe` SHA-256 is
  `00474ad34dc707aaab942e3c863c9eaf3bdf0fa3406b1fe8703cdae713f586f4`.
  Packaged startup reached the post-construction marker, and the hidden packaged
  Vortice GPU smoke passed with renderer `d3d11_vortice_shader` and 0.4396 ms
  handler p95.
- The explicit read-only real-game gate passed through the production
  .NET/Vortice renderer (`d3d11_vortice_shader`) and resident edit backend
  `cdmw_mesh_core_0.1`. It bound three archive-provenance textures, completed an
  exact 40-pixel viewport drag with zero projection error, changed only 12
  selected vertices, kept the window stationary, recorded 1.6333 ms edit-handler
  p95 and 151.9153 ms maximum heartbeat gap, and left PAMT/PAZ fingerprints
  unchanged. Evidence:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-dotnet-0bc29c1d9f474adbb8e3a10eb7771987\evidence_report.json`.
- The whole-codebase repair plan passed its final sequence and was removed from
  `docs/plans/active/`.

2026-07-10:

- Canonical `codex_check -Area mesh` now routes to
  `real-archive-mesh-editor-dotnet-edit-smoke`, not the legacy C++ D3D11 host.
- Read-only proof passed with the exact nude PAC
  `character/model/1_pc/14_ptm/nude/cd_ptm_00_nude_00_0001.pac`, three
  archive-provenance DDS bindings, renderer `d3d11_vortice_shader`, edit backend
  `cdmw_mesh_core_0.1`, 12 selected-only changed vertices, 1.214 ms main-thread
  handler p95, 101.14 ms maximum heartbeat gap, stationary renderer HWNDs, and
  unchanged PAMT/PAZ SHA-256 fingerprints.
- Legacy C++ D3D11 scenarios remain explicit compatibility/protocol coverage;
  synthetic checker geometry is blocked by default. Normal/full pytest still
  excludes only `visual` and `real_game` markers.
- Release .NET helper publication now runs a hidden Vortice GPU smoke; helper
  preflight requires both the .NET renderer and `cdmw-mesh-core.exe`.

2026-07-08:

- Focused static replacement, D3D11 package, native preview core, and Mesh
  Editor action-bar tests passed: 353 passed.
- Alignment dialog and Mesh Edit responsiveness source guards passed: 149
  passed.
- Release dirty-tree preflight classifies untracked project source/docs under
  known repo roots; generated output and untracked source outside those roots
  still block release packaging.
- `build.bat onedir release` produced
  `dist/CrimsonDesertModWorkbench-0.10.0-alpha.2-windows/CrimsonDesertModWorkbench.exe`
  14,462,895 bytes, SHA256
  `EB7180A38330E48725D33F78839A73F8FFDE9A85F53218892293F86426BCF1A9`.
- Packaged onedir startup smoke passed with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` and
  `CDMW_GUI_STARTUP_SMOKE=1`.

- Full pytest suite passed from the current worktree: 4236 passed / 5 skipped.
- Release onefile package rebuilt from the current worktree, rebuilt native
  helpers, published the .NET Mesh Editor experiment helper, and validated all
  485 embedded archive members.
- Fresh packaged EXE startup smoke passed with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` and
  `CDMW_GUI_STARTUP_SMOKE=1`.
- Native Mesh Editor benchmark passed with native core available and no fallback
  events on a 100806-vertex / 200344-face session; resident edit/history metrics
  were present and `benchmark_target_ok=true`.
- Qt responsiveness and cancellation harnesses passed with native core available
  and no fallback events. Responsiveness dispatch returned in about `0.05 ms`
  with first progress in about `2.29 ms`; cancellation dispatch returned in
  about `0.07 ms` with first progress in about `2.33 ms` and cancel latency
  about `28.79 ms`.
- Packaged onefile Mesh Editor startup smoke passed against
  `D:\Byggverkstaden\test_mesh_editor\cd_phm_00_nude_10_0001.pac` with both
  `CDMW_GUI_STARTUP_SMOKE_MESH_ASSET_REBUILD=1` and
  `CDMW_GUI_STARTUP_SMOKE_MESH_DOTNET=1`, covering file-session load,
  validation, no-op roundtrip, editable package export/import, rebuilt PAC
  output, .NET handoff, .NET output import, and post-import validation.
- Real-game Mesh Editor D3D11 proof passed through
  `.\scripts\codex_check.ps1 -Area mesh -GameRoot "C:\games\Steam\steamapps\common\Crimson Desert"`,
  using `character/model/1_pc/14_ptm/nude/cd_ptm_00_nude_00_0001.pac`
  from `C:\games\Steam\steamapps\common\Crimson Desert\0009\0.pamt`.
  The proof used 7227 vertices / 13296 faces, selected and moved a real face
  cluster, had no native fallback events, kept live stroke handler p95 about
  `5.65 ms`, D3D11 send p95 about `0.228 ms`, and native apply roundtrip p95
  about `4.27 ms`, under the 16.7 ms handler frame budget. Latest proof output:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-d3d11-side-by-side-codex-check`.
- Release artifact:
  `dist/CrimsonDesertModWorkbench-0.10.0-alpha.2-windows-portable.exe`

2026-07-06:

- Release onefile package rebuilt from the current MeshAsset GLB-first editable-package
  rebuild/.NET/developer-override smoke tree after the material-slot-count, raw-vertex-record,
  raw-record-sidecar, material-slot-sidecar, unknown-section-sidecar,
  unknown-field-sidecar, LOD-identity-sidecar, LOD-section-range, vertex-stride,
  source-offset, unknown-metadata, native-clone LOD metadata, and packaged
  `mesh.cdmeta.json` schema validation gates plus the real-game smoke guard, native helpers rebuilt,
  .NET Mesh Editor experiment helper published, 485 embedded archive members validated,
  packaged startup smoke passed, visible Mesh Editor native Performance panel and
  FPS/frame-time status wiring were focused-tested, and packaged Mesh Editor asset rebuild plus
  metric-enforced .NET handoff smoke passed with
  `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`, `CDMW_GUI_STARTUP_SMOKE=1`,
  `CDMW_GUI_STARTUP_SMOKE_TARGET=mesh_editor`, and
  both `CDMW_GUI_STARTUP_SMOKE_MESH_ASSET_REBUILD=1` and
  `CDMW_GUI_STARTUP_SMOKE_MESH_DOTNET=1`.
- Current real-game Mesh Editor D3D11 proof used
  `character/model/1_pc/14_ptm/nude/cd_ptm_00_nude_00_0001.pac` from
  `C:\games\Steam\steamapps\common\Crimson Desert\0009\0.pamt`.
  The latest side-by-side smoke selected and moved a real face cluster, wrote
  `real_archive_visual_edit_proof.png`, had no native fallback events, and kept
  live stroke handler p95 about `14.92 ms`, D3D11 send p95 about `0.256 ms`, and
  native apply roundtrip p95 about `13.16 ms`, under the 16.7 ms handler frame
  budget. Latest proof output:
  `%TEMP%\cdmw-real-archive-mesh-editor-d3d11-side-by-side-codex-check`.
- Mesh unit/protocol regression gate passed after the native preview
  malformed-geometry guard: the old synthetic mesh gate is now explicitly
  `.\scripts\codex_check.ps1 -Area mesh-unit`, not visual proof, and reported
  702 passed / 4 deselected.
- Non-mesh regression gates passed:
  `.\scripts\codex_check.ps1 -Area smoke` reported 8 passed, and
  `.\scripts\codex_check.ps1 -Area archive` reported 88 passed.
- Current Qt responsiveness/cancel harnesses passed with native core available
  and no fallback events. Responsiveness dispatch returned in about `0.06 ms`
  with first progress in about `2.49 ms`; cancellation dispatch returned in
  about `0.06 ms` with first progress in about `2.62 ms` and cancel latency
  about `31.1 ms`.
- The packaged Mesh Editor asset smoke loaded
  `D:\Byggverkstaden\test_mesh_editor\cd_phm_00_nude_10_0001.pac` through the
  real file-session path, required validation plus no-op roundtrip `PASS`,
  exported an editable package, reimported it, validated the imported package,
  wrote a rebuilt PAC to a temp output path, launched the bundled
  `cdmw-mesh-dotnet-editor.exe` helper in headless mode, imported the .NET
  output package, reran validation, and required a
  `replace_positions_same_count` edit operation, positive .NET FPS/frame-time
  metrics, and `dotnet_evaluation.md`.
- Onefile archive inspection found the Mesh Editor native/runtime helpers:
  `native\cdmw-mesh-core.exe`, `native\cdmw-d3d11-preview.exe`,
  `native\cdmw-preview-core.exe`, `native\cd-texture-dx.exe`, and
  `native\cdmw-mesh-dotnet-editor.exe`, plus
  `schemas\mesh\mesh.cdmeta.schema.json`.
